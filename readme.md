fa la la la la give me my framework please and thank you :)))))))))
# plaintrade
A paper trading platform simulator.. thing. idk really
## so what's this
the original plan was to have it be an actual paper trader.. you know with like real stocks and crypto and stuff.. then i got to the api part and fully noped out

anyway, instead you have a cooler paper trader for even cooler stocks!! tell me right now you wouldn't invest in chicken nuggets if you were able to. because you'd be a liar.
## features
yeah so we got cool stuff like
- buying and selling stocks
- shorting and covering shorts!!! shorting is fun i love betting on peoples downfall
- watchlisting the stocks
- a bunch of super cool charts! 
- just generally good design I guess. I think this is the proudest I've ever been of a css design I made.

## controls
umm like mouse I guess? idk maybe here's the time to mention that "your positions" and "your trades" are meant to be dropdowns if it's not obvious

## final notes
framework framework lalalalala give me framework lalalalla give me freedom lalalalala slavery is over lalalalala
